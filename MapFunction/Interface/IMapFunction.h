 * @date 12/18/21  Original creation
 * 
 * @details
 *      An interface for different types of map functions. A map function is
 * simply a function that converts one range of values to another range of 
 * values by any means. The original map function equation I used was just an 
 * equation for linear interpolation. I had used it many, many years ago with 
 * the Arduino "map()" function. Hence the name. I used the linear equation 
 * and created my own little ecosystem around to allow different kinds of map 
 * functions to be used. 
 * 
 * Objects that use this interface must implement the functions listed in the 
 * interface. To make a MapFunction, you will need to make a base class 
 * MapFunction object and a subclass MapFunction object. The base class 
 * contains at minimum, a pointer to the sub class's interface and a void 
 * pointer called "instance". Your subclass function will use your subclass 
 * type object, but the function calls will be using the base class type. The 
 * reason the void pointer is used is so that the user does not have to deal 
 * with typecasting every function call. The void pointer will be changed to 
 * point to your subclass object. 
 * 
 * The MFInterface or function table will tell the interface which functions 
 * to call. Your implementation of the MapFunction will have its own functions
 * that use your subclass type as arguments. Declare and initialize a 
 * MFInterface object and set its members (which are function pointers) to 
 * each of your functions. References to the base class are replaced with void.
 * You will need to typecast your functions for this step.
 * 
 * A sub class will contain at minimum, a pointer to the base class named 
 * "super". After creating a sub class, it needs to be connected to the base 
 * class by using the MF_Create function. This function will set the void 
 * pointer for you. I think the best way to do this is to create your own sub
 * class create function that is not part of the interface, and have it accept
 * both the base class and sub class as arguments. Then, inside that function
 * set the "super" pointer and any other variables. Then call MF_Create last.
 * Doing it this way makes the process a little more type-safe by ensuring the
 * void pointer doesn't get set incorrectly.
 * 
 * @section example_code Example Code
 *      MapFunction mapFunction;
 *      SubClassMap linearMapType;
 *      SubClassMap_Create(&mapFunction, &linearMapType, param1, ...)
 *      output = MF_Compute(&mapFunction, input);
