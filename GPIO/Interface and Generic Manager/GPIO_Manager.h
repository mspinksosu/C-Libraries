 * @brief GPIO Library Manager Header (Non-Processor Specific)

 * 
 * @details
 *     This is a simple piece of code that handles initializing all of the pins 
 * on the MCU. It also handles access to the GPIO pins for other files.
 * 
 * The code in the GPIO library should really only deal with modifying the 
 * pins. It should not be concerned with how the user manages their pin 
 * organization. Furthermore, The GPIO implementation will always have some 
 * sort of processor specific dependency. So if the user were to include the
 * header for that file they wouldn't be able to port their code as easily to 
 * a different processor.
 * 
 * Calls to the GPIO functions are done with the base GPIO type. Because of 
 * this, functions that may need access to the pins only need to use the base 
 * class object.
 * 
 * The first step in the initialization process is to set the GPIO driver
 * interface or function table by calling GPIO_SetDriverInterface. This table 
 * is created inside a processor specific GPIO library, which is library that 
 * implements the functions listed in IGPIO.h. After that, each pins properties
 * can be set and the GPIO_Init function can be called once for every pin that 
 * is needed.
