 * @details
 *      I am currently testing three different types of PRNG. The LCG is an 
 * extension of a basic linear congruential generator, except that this one 
 * makes use of 64-bit math to get a longer output. The basic formula for an 
 * LCG is: "X_n+1 = (a * X_n + c) % m". LCG's have an advantage of being very 
 * fast if m is chosen to me a power of two because the modulus can be reduced 
 * to a logical AND. The downside is that only the upper bits of the LCG are 
 * psuedo random. The typical rand function uses this sort of LCG. The state 
 * is a 32-bit variable, but only 15 bits are used. (bits 30 through 16).
 * My version just expands upon this to get a bigger number. Instead of using 
 * a 32-bit variable, it uses 64-bit variables to store the state and returns 
 * the upper 32 bits. When the parameters a, m, and c are chosen correctly, the 
 * period of the LCG is m.
 * 
 * The Park Miller is special type of LCG that has removes the increment value 
 * c and has more restrictions in the choice of the multiplier a and modulus m. 
 * The value m is chosen to be a prime number close to range of the desired 
 * output. This is why you see the number 2^31-1 pop up lot. It is a Mersenne 
 * prime number that is close to the word size of 32-bits. There are also other 
 * restrictions placed on the relationship between a and m. The Park Miller is 
 * also sometimes referred to as a "Multiplicative Linear Congruential 
 * Generator". Its output is much better than the basic LCG but it is slower  // TODO notes about PM value of 0 and X_0
 * because it uses modulus of a prime number. When a and m are chosen correctly, 
 * the period of the Park Miller is m - 1. In fact, the Park Miller LCG is 
 * a "full-cycle" LCG. Meaning it will produce every number from 1 to m-1 
 * once before the sequence repeats.
