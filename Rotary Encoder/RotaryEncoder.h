 * @date 2/21/22    Added Doxygen
 * @date 7/2/22     Redesigned to add different encoders and debouncing
 * 
 * @details
 *      A library that handles a basic quadrature rotary encoder. Quadrature 
 * rotary encoders have two traits that define them. The number of pulses per 
 * revolution (PPR) and the number of detents. Our goal is to generate a change 
 * in the output every time the knob moves one "click" or detent. Then we 
 * set a clockwise or counterclockwise event flag. To do all of this, you must
 * first know how many PPR and how many detents you have.
 * 
 * By far, the most common type of rotary encoder is one that has half the 
 * number of detents as PPR. We refer to this as a "1/2 cycle per detent" 
 * rotary encoder. This means the knob stops on a detent halfway through the 
 * quadrature output cycle. There are also rotary encoders that have the same 
 * number of PPR as detents ("full cycle per detent") and even 1/4 cycle per 
 * detent rotary encoders. This last one has a detent on every state change in 
 * the cycle. If you don't know what your rotary encoder is, it's probably the 
 * 1/2 cycle per detent type.
 * 
 * You also need the debounce time in milliseconds and the expected update rate 
 * in milliseconds (how often you plan to call the tick function). If you are 
 * debouncing using an RC filter, use 0 as the debounce time. For the tick 
 * rate, you should be updating the rotary encoder fairly quickly. If you 
 * update it too slow, it may feel sluggish. Most datasheets I've looked at 
 * recommend a 5 ms debounce time. So if you're debouncing using software, 
 * you'll probably want to call the update function at around that speed or 
 * faster. If you are using RC filters to debounce, you can probably get away 
 * with going slower. The maximum available debounce time for debouncing with 
 * software is 255 ms.
 * 
 * There are two callback functions for clockwise and counter clockwise events. 
 * The function you create must follow the prototype listed as RECallbackFunc. 
 * It must have a void pointer as an argument. When your function gets called, 
 * you will get a pointer to the RotaryEncoder object that initiated the call. 
 * This way, you can have multiple callbacks pointing to the same function 
 * if you desire. Then inside your callback function you would compare the 
 * pointer with your RotaryEncoder object to determine which one initiated the 
 * callback. You do not have to use the contextPointer if you do not want to. 
 * The reason it is a void pointer is so that you can have your callback 
 * function in some other file without needing to include the RotaryEncoder.h 
 * header file. After you've created your function, call 
 * SetClockwiseEventCallback or SetCounterClockwiseEventCallback and give 
 * it your function as an argument.
 * 
 * @section example_code Example Code
 *      RotaryEncoder myEncoder;
 *      RE_InitWithType(&myEncoder, RE_FULL_CYCLE_PER_DETENT, 5, 1);
 *      // call update phases once per tick
 *      RE_UpdatePhases(&myEncoder, GPIO_ReadPin(&pinA), GPIO_ReadPin(&pinB));
 *      if(RE_GetClockwise(&myEncoder))
 *      { .... do something .... }
 *      if(RE_GetCounterClockwise(&myEncoder))
 *      { .... do something .... }

 * Description of struct members: You shouldn't need to mess with any of these
 * variables directly.
 * 
 * clockwiseEventCallback  A function that is called when a clockwise event
 *                         occurs.
 * 
 * counterClockwiseEventCallback  A function that is called when a counter
 *                                clockwise event occurs.
 * 
 * typeMask  A variable that alters the output to be every 1/4, 1/2, or full
 *           cycle.
 * 
 * debouncePeriod  How long to debounce the rotary encoder switches (in ticks)
 * 
 * phaseIntegrator  A counter that will smooth the input in order to debounce
 *                  it. When it hits either 0 or the debounce period, the 
 *                  output changes.
 * 
 * state  Stores the current state of the phase inputs, as well as the previous
 *        state.
 * 
 * output  An int that indicates which direction the rotary encoder is turning.
 *         If the rotary encoder is going clockwise, it will go from 1 to 127
 *         then rollover. If counter clockwise, it will go from -1 to -128
 * 
 * clockwise  A flag that indicates a clockwise event occurred
 * 
 * counterClockwise  A flag that indicates a counter clockwise event occurred
